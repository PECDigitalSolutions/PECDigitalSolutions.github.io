            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Hi, I’m Philip Ericsson, a 26-year-old tech enthusiast from Skövde, Sweden. 
            Outside of my day job working with system development, 
            you’ll often find me at the gym or diving into a new video game. 
            I love tackling diverse challenges in coding and constantly pushing my personal boundaries—whether 
            that's through fitness or learning new tech skills. I’m all about finding the right balance 
            between work and downtime, which means I cherish my time catching up with friends 
            and staying inspired by the latest tech trends.<br>

            I’m really excited about the future and have big plans to start my 
            own consulting company one day. For now, I’m enjoying the flexibility 
            of working from home couple of days in the week and focusing on growing both personally and professionally. 
            My goal is to combine my passion for technology with my entrepreneurial spirit to 
            make a real difference in the field.</p>
